# YOLOv5 Mask Detection

This project focuses on using YOLOv5 for object detection to detect masks in images. The dataset used for training contains images of people wearing masks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model contains a collection of images of people wearing masks. Each image is labeled with bounding boxes around the faces with masks.

## Model Training

The YOLOv5 model is trained on the dataset to detect masks in images. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to accurately detect masks in different scenarios.

## Inference

After training, the model can be used to perform inference on new images to detect masks. The model is able to accurately identify whether a person in the image is wearing a mask or not.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing in detecting masks.

## Results

The trained model can be applied to new images to detect masks. The results of the detection process can be visualized to see how well the model is performing.

## Example
